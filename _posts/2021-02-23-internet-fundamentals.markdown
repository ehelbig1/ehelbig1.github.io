At a 10,000 foot view, the internet is nothing more than a group of computers spread across the world.
These computers are able to send and recieve messages, often refered to as packets, from each other.
Similar to the postal service, each computer is given an address where packets can be sent. These addresses
are called <em>Internet Protocol (IP)</em> addresses and are represented by four numbers separated by a period.
For example **127.0.0.1**.
