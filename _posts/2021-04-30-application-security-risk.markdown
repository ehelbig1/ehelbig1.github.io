# Risk

Application Security is about minimizing risk. It is about reducing the likelihood that our people, systems, and data will be used in a way that will result in damage to an organization, whether financial or physical.

Its common to consider security as simply preventing the malicious use of information and systems but risk is about understanding what could happen, and how, to prioritize focus. Calculating risk is a balance between what can be done to an organization or system, how likely it is to happen, and the overall cost if it does happen.

## Vulnerability

A vulnerability, in an application, is a flaw or bug that allows the misuse, exposure, or harm of a system, data, or people. A vulnerability in itself is harmless but, when exploited, can result in damages.

### Likelihood

**Likelihood** is a measurement of easy or likely it is for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability. It is a very subjective measurement but the following points can be evaluated to calculate a vulnerabilities likelihood of exploitation.

- Technical skill required
  - What level of knowledge about the technology is needed? Is a high-level knowledge enough or would it require a technical specialist?
- Reliability
  - Does the exploit work every time?
  - Is the exploit effective for different versions, platforms, and architectures?
  - The more reliable an exploit, the less likely it is to cause noticeable side effects and it may be safer for attackers.
- Automation
  - Is the exploit easily automated?
  - This can help its inclusion in tools and is more likely to result in indiscriminate attacks.
- Access
  - What level of access to the system is needed?
  - Do other parts of the system need to be compromised first?
- Motivation
  - Is the result of the exploit worth the effort?

### Cost

**Impact** is the effect the exploitation of a vulnerability has on an organization or its customers. Its common to measure this loss in a monetary value. This can be as concrete as the theft of funds and the cost of recovering from a breach or as abstract as the loss of customer trust.

As the world moves toward more automation and applications are controlling self driving cars, medical devices, and light bulbs the impact of a security vulnerabilities will continue to grow.

## Minimizing Risk

Risk is unavoidable and is often about external influences to a system, organization, and people. As such, we need to focus on understanding risks, minimizing their impacts, and monitoring the domain for new and evolving risks. The acceptance of risk is acceptable when that risk and its impacts are well understood.

While minimizing risk, it is important to consider the restraints faced by systems, organizations, and people. It all comes down to the amount of time and resources available to minimize risk. Regardless of these limitations, something can be done and doing nothing is no longer acceptable.
